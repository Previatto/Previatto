Greetings!

I am Previatto.

I am 32 years old and for the past 3 years I have been studying data science.

Since college (where I learned about Python) I have a fondness for neural networks, how they work? How can you code a neuron?

And after that in a internship I discovered that I love to look into data and try to answer question and solve problems with it!

Lately I have been messing with some deep learning and trying to learn (pun intended) more about it.
